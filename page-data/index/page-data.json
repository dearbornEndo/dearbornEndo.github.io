My diabetes has never been under better control than it is now under his care.  He is thorough and takes time with you during his appointments.  The staff is very professional and wades through the insurance mire very effectively."},{"author":"Lori Aldrich","quote":"I saw another area endocrinologist for many years. I had to switch to Dr Saleh for insurance reasons. He walked in the room and suspected a disease that scans show I've had for years, yet I was never tested for. Post surgery, I'm now on my way to recovery."},{"author":"Julie Dupon","quote":"Dr. Salah is a fantastic doctor. When my husband was in the hospital, he was there every day checking up on him, monitoring his blood sugars, working with all the other doctors to bring my husbands health back. As a nurse, he is one of the best doctors who listens to what's going on, and is very involved in his patients care. He is an excellent physician and human being!!"},{"author":"Colleen Waun","quote":"Dr. Saleh is a progressive, kind, & an empathetic doctor.   He is patient and allows you to provide feedback.  His staff is super nice, too."}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"59baabf8-8a22-51c0-bd2d-d2afd1eb330a"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2744294623"]}
